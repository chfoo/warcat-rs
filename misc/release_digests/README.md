# Release digests

Hash digests and signatures of published releases.

These files are provided for those who want to verify the downloads.

Digests are in hexadecimal.

These file are intended to be updated by the publisher and to be authenticated using signed git commits. The xtask crate can be used to generate the contents.

PGP and Minisign files are not uploaded because GitHub's interface shows all uploaded files in a single list which can confuse users with too many files to choose from.
